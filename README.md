Bardough -the-fun-little-command-prompt-game.   

Created by Jeremy115  

This game is made a bit different than a regular game. This is a fun command prompt game and its whole purpose is to try and break the game. Every way you can try to break the game you can try. You will fail, but in the end the reason for this game is to have fun finding all the extra text that you can find trying to break this small little game.   

This is a fun little project I made to branch my coding languages and knowledge. Since Python, Java, and C++ are the languages I am extremely familiar with, I thought making a small little game in C# would challenge myself to learn a different language and improve my problem-solving capabilities.  


Now, Let's get into the game itself.   


This game is made for fun. It is not serious in any way. Well, maybe it is serious according to the way you choose to play it. You can just answer each of Bardough's questions correctly and just progress the game. Thats not the intended way, but you can.  

This is a game where you want to find a way to say something that makes the narrator(Bardough) kind of irritated. Where you want to give him different answers and get creative with it. The goal of this little command prompt game is to make a fun little enjoyable experience where you don't know what the narrator will say next as you progress. Which will add a lot of enjoyable moments for you, the player. 

Lets say you were to input a "b" and a "g" into the question where the narrartor ask for your gender the narrator knows you can be anything but will say the programmer(me) was lazy to not add this feature and must ask you again if you are a Boy("b") or a girl("g"). These type of narrator/player conversations adds to the experience and continue throughout the game as you progress. 

With that in mind. You have various abilities you are given as you answer narrator's questions. Your attributes are dependent on several variables (for now) age, height, and gender of the character you created. These variables will be defined into your speed, charisma, strength, and accuracy.  

As time goes on, I will work more on this game and will talk to the narrator about different task to give the player, but until then, it stands as a small unbeatable game where you die in the first stage you enter (for now).  

I hope everyone that can see this will be able to enjoy this little demo of what the vision of this game can be.  


**Remember this program is made for fun and to sharpen my programming skills and expand my programming language knowledge. As of now, I have no plans on implementing this to an actual game. It will always be a fun project for me to work on.
