This game is made a bit different than a regular game. This is a fun command prompt game and its whole purpose is to try and break the game. Every way you can try to break the game you can try. You will fail, but in the end the reason for this game is to have fun finding all the extra text that you can find trying to break this small little game.  

This is a fun little project I made to branch my coding languages and knowledge. Since Python, Java, and C++ are the languages I am extremely familiar with, I thought making a small little game in C# would challenge myself to learn a different language and improve my problem-solving capabilities. 

  
Now, Let's get into the game itself.  

This game is made for fun. It is not serious in any way. Well, maybe it is serious accodring to the way you choose to play it. You can just answer each of his questions correctly and just progress the game. Thats not the intended way.
